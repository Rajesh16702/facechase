The idea is to make a camera rotate to keep the camera focused on a person.

# Getting started

## Download and uncompress yolo model
Since github does not allow the huge files, we have put the yolo model in Google drive here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e-_Da66yaZeySoGy8xjSAPQ9SOPV5OLJ?usp=sharing

Download and uncompress the model file such that the yolov3.weights file is available in yolo-object-detection/yolo-coco/

## Run
Start with:
  cd yolo-object-detection
  python main.py

# Requirements
You will have to set up - opencv, pandas, numpy etc.
