# Tasks
- Get the USB camera
- Capture the image from camera opencv
- get prediction from YOLO
- Test if the camera is available parallely in zoom
- Assemble the Gimble

# Flow
- Load YOLO Model
## Phase 1
- Calibration of camera
    - Capture the image from camera
    - Pass image to YOLO Model - Get the rectangle of person.
    - If person is found, 
        Move the camera a little and observe the change in the position
        Move the camera in the proportion of the change
        Keep record of the proportion - maximum angle required to cover the full image - camera's FOV - may be we can have a separate script
    - If the person is not found,
        Wait for sometime - announce
        Move to right +90
- Person Tracker
    - Capture the image from camera
    - Pass image to YOLO Model - Get the rectangle of person.
    - Get the object tracker on
    - If the center is beyond 10% distance from the center, move the camera to LEft, RIGHT, TOP OR BOTTOM


import cv2

camera = cv2.VideoCapture(1)
i = 0
while i < 10:
    input('Press Enter to capture')
    return_value, image = camera.read()
    cv2.imwrite('opencv'+str(i)+'.png', image)
    i += 1

del(camera)
